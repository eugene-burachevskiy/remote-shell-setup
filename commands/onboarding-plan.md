# Create My Onboarding Plan



I'm a new team member joining this project and I need help creating a structured onboarding plan.



My background My background will be specified at the end of the message. If I didn't specify the background, please ask me for the background before answering the question. 



Please create a personalized phased onboarding plan that includes the following phases.



## Phase 1 - Foundation



Environment setup with step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting tips, plus identifying the most important documentation to read first



## Phase 2 - Exploration



Codebase discovery starting with README files, running existing tests/scripts to understand workflows, and finding beginner-friendly first tasks like documentation improvements. If possible, find me specific open issues or tasks that are suitable for my background.



## Phase 3 - Integration



Learning team processes, making first contributions, and building confidence through early wins



For each phase, break down complex topics into manageable steps, recommend relevant resources, provide concrete next steps, and suggest hands-on practice over just reading theory.
